# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The IDP-System is built on a modular architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. The system is composed of the following main components:

### Core Components

1. **Input Processing Layer**
   - Handles various input sources (files, URLs, scanner)
   - Validates and normalizes input data

2. **Document Classification Engine**
   - Identifies document types using AI models
   - Supports multiple document types (ID cards, passports, etc.)

3. **Region of Interest (ROI) Extraction**
   - Identifies and extracts relevant regions from documents
   - Specialized for different document types

4. **OCR Processing Pipeline**
   - Multiple OCR engines for different languages and use cases
   - Language-specific preprocessing and postprocessing
   - Fallback mechanisms for improved accuracy

5. **Template Parsing Engine**
   - Extracts structured data from OCR results
   - Document-specific parsing rules

6. **API Layer**
   - RESTful API for integration with other systems
   - Authentication and rate limiting
